**processor_tools** provides tools to support the development of processing pipelines. The core of this involves building `Processor` classes that are subclasses of :py:class:`BaseProcessor <processor_tools.processor.BaseProcessor>`. This section of user guide provides information for how to build and use your own `Processor` classes.
